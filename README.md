# Cognia

What is Cognia? 

Cognia is a Python library that automatically performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on datasets and generates structured insights, visualizations, and summaries with minimal user effort.

Instead of manually writing repetitive code to understand a dataset, Cognia allows users to analyze data in a single line of code, saving time and reducing cognitive load.

🧠 Why Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Matters

Before building any machine learning model or performing statistical analysis, analysts must understand:

- Dataset size and structure

- Missing values

- Data types

- Distribution of numeric features

- Presence of outliers

- Correlation between variables

Traditionally, this requires many lines of repetitive code, manual interpretation, and experience.

👉 Cognia automates this entire thinking process.
